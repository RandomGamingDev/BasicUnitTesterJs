# BasicUnitTesterJs
BasicUnitTesterJs is a basic javascript unit tester designed to work on all JS platforms and be small and streamlined for the best developer experience.

A nice thing about this test being able to run everywhere, is that
tests aren't just limited to your specific platform since the tests can be easily ported from say NodeJS to Browser JS or Bun!

The documentation for it is here: https://randomgamingdev.github.io/EzDok/#v1/%22https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomGamingDev/BasicUnitTesterJs/main/documentation/documentation.dok%22/0/

To use it, you can simply import it as a cdn from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/BasicUnitTesterJs/unit-tester.js (add .min before .js for the minified version), import into your project, or copy and paste `unit-tester.js` into your editor!
